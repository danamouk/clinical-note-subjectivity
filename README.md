# A clinician-generated dataset for detecting implicit biases in electronic patient records.

Subjectivity is very context dependent in clinical notes, we use active learning and a BERT model to extract subjective language from clinical notes in MIMIC-III, to support analysis of differential correlations across sensitive patient groups, as well as to explore how subjectivity relates to objective clinical outcomes.

# Annotation Task
Clinical experts label phrases in context, considering a 50-character window before and after each lexicon word. The annotation is performed through a user interface, where clinical experts accept or reject each phrase presented by answering the question: "Does this phrase represent an opinion in the given context?"
